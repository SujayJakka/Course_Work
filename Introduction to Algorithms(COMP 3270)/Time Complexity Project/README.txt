Sujay Jakka and Shane Rivera

File included in the zip archive includes README.txt, ProgrammingAssignment.java, ProgrammingAssignment.class, and Sujay and Shane COMP3270 Programming Assignment.docx.

I used javac compiler and ran the commands "javac ProgrammmingAssignment.java" and then "java ProgrammingAssignment" to run the program. If program by chance does not compile, run it as an administrator.

I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting. I did not copy whole or parts of it from another student or have another person write the code for me. Any code I am reusing in my program is clearly marked as such with its source clearly identified in comments.

The program will not run unless the input file, phw_input.txt, is contained in the same directory as the ProgrammingAssignment.java file.

The details of complexity order calculations, graphs, and explanations for all the graphs are in the file Sujay and Shane COMP3270 Programming Assignment.docx.
