When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input

The tricky part about doing this was I ran out GPU compute I could use from Google Collab, so I was doing most of my tuning on my CPU which took a lot longer. I first tried the Three-Layer ConvNet with SGD using Nesterov Momentum. I experimented with a variety of learning rates. Then I tried a deeper network by adding 3 more convolution layers and also experimenting with the Adam optimizer and L2 regularization. Furthermore, it was very difficult to tell from just the loss if my model was overfitting or underfitting. If the training accuracy was present, I would have had an easier time understanding if I needed more regularization as I could not really tell how good or bad the loss was relative to the validation accuracy. I then experimented with max pooling after the first 4 convolutional layers and average pooling for after the last convolutional layer. The final model I chose was the deeper network with 5 convolutional layers with spatial batch normalization and max pooling. I also added L2 regularization with a value of 0.001 and chose the Adam optimizer.
