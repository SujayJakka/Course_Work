PROJECT REPORT

Task 1: Setting up Linux programming environment

- This task went pretty smoothly for me, I just followed the instructions that were provided.

Task 2: Using Linux Commands

- This task was a bit trickier because there were some commands I never used before such as chmod command.

Task 3: Getting to know your system

- This task was pretty straightforward, I was able to get the output of the commands to pipe into the appropriate files on the first try.

Task 4: Using gcc and gdb

- This task was pretty fun because I never debugged in the terminal before. I always debugged using an IDE. Also, it took me a couple of tries for me to properly figure out how to use gdb but the geeksforgeeks tutorial helped a lot.

Task 5: Using git

- This task allowed me to really understand git from the ground-up. I used git before, but there were a lot of things I did not understand and this task allowed me to clarify those things. The project instructions and the documentation on the git site helped a lot.
